Based in Dubai I have a love for Crypto currencies in general but I believe Tron is the future 

I am 43 years old and I live in Dubai, my name is Nick I am married with 2 Children and 2 PUGS (Pugs are awssssssssome). I am an Entrepreneur and I have a passion to grow the business I work for and that will translate into the Tron network if I am voted to become a Super Representative  

My aim is to be an investor into as many Tron projects as possible to grow the network and infrastructure
